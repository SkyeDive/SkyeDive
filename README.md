## Hi there!
I'm Skye, I use she/her pronouns, and I like to do coding in my spare time (some products of which you can find here!)

(Most of) the things here I've worked on by myself, and I *probably* don't intend to change that,
but if you want to reach out (say, to suggest something for a project), feel free to contact me!
If it's not for anything professional, I'd prefer being contacted on Discord at `cereal#8934`
- My native language is Lua, and I have over 5 years of self-taught experience in it
- Currently learning C++ at college (at time of writing)
- Obsessed with foxes (Vulpes vulpes) and fluffy space raptors (Iubati avali)
